    <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
<p>Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The lorem ipsum text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

    Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.
    
    Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called "kitty ipsum" text.
